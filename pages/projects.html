    <p class="text"> “Code smells are symptoms of poor design and imple- mentation choices that may hinder code comprehension and possibly increase change- and fault-proneness of source code. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature for detecting code smells. These techniques are generally evaluated by comparing their accuracy on a set of detected candidate code smells against a manually-produced oracle. Unfortunately, such comprehensive sets of annotated code smells are not available in the literature with only few exceptions. In this paper we contribute (i) a dataset of 243 instances of five types of code smells identified from 20 open source software projects, (ii) a systematic procedure for validating code smell datasets, (iii) LANDFILL, a Web-based platform for sharing code smell datasets, and (iv) a set of APIs for programmatically accessing LANDFILL’s contents. Anyone can contribute to Landfill by (i) improving existing datasets (e.g., adding missing instances of code smells, flagging possibly incorrectly classified instances), and (ii) sharing and posting new datasets. Landfill is available at <a href="http://www.sesa.unisa.it/landfill/"> www.sesa.unisa.it/landfill/</a>” <br><br>

    <p class="text"> “During software evolution change is the rule rather than the exception. Unfortunately, such changes 
        are usually performed by developers that due to strict deadlines do not have enough time to make sure that every change 
        conforms to OOP guidelines, such as, minimizing coupling and maximizing cohesion of classes. <br>
        Such careless design solutions often lead to design antipatterns, which negatively impact the quality of a software 
        system, making its maintenance difficult and expensive. <br>
        The presence of antipatterns makes the maintenance of a software system difficult (due to the effort required to 
        comprehend the source code) and dangerous (since empirical studies showed that classes with low quality are more 
        error-prone than other classes). Refactoring operations are need to remove such antipatterns from the source code. <br>
        However, the identification of such operations is not trivial and it might be time-consuming. The ARIES project aims 
        at supporting several refactoring operations in Eclipse, such as Extract Class and Extract Package, Move Method and 
        Move Class.” <br><br>
